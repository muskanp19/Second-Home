                <h1>WHY HOMESTAY ?</h1>

                <p>A HOMESTAY is essentially the commercialization of the home. This
                    commercialization has disrupted economies throughout the world, resulted
                    in gentrification and globalization, and is largely anything but cultural
                    tourism. Homestay tourism is a specialized cognitive form of tourism that
                    focuses on culture and heritage of the particular destination. Homestay
                    tourism is popular in many destinations; it adds authentic sociocultural
                    richness to the tourists experience. For a nation which possesses an
                    abundance of tourism richness in remote communities, homestays are an
                    attractive alternative tourism product. It was also homestay hosting is
                    beneficial to host families as it offers social interaction and preservation of
                    local culture, a sense of local pride, income and employment, and
                    educational opportunities for operators; children such as becoming more
                    multilingual. Homestays just as tourism industry would require manpower
                    with sufficient experience and training to deliver best homestay for the
                    tourists hence training for development, maintenance and operations of
                    homestays is vital aspect for the industry to grow more. <br> <br>

                    Home stay tourism is an emerging tourism concept evolved lately in the tourism world. India can be a
                    model homestay for its multi-faceted potentialities. Natural gifts, man-made heritages
                    ethno-cultural richness, innocent social settings, pleasant hospitality and many more unexplored
                    treasures that are dreams for experts of tourism. Homestay tourism cannot prosper sans the
                    convergence of needs of the affluent and the needy based on the premise of demand driven mechanism
                    because it is a need base concept. India can harness the boon of tourist potentiality rampant at the
                    rural areas where government has pro-poor programs. This form of tourism is based on three aspects
                    namely service, facility and attraction. India has a strong position only in attraction whereas it
                    is lacking in facility and services. Sustainable tourism takes place if home grown resources and
                    natural settings are effectively served to the tourism as well as also preserved. Promotion of
                    tourism thus is highly dependent upon the active participation of the private sector and communities
                    where the role of government becomes that of a facilitator.

                <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HOMESTAY</h1>

                <p> A Home-Stay, by its combined words (home stay) is staying in some one's home as a paying guest for
                    short time period. But such guests are provided accommodation and services by individual family and
                    community too. Therefore, the Home- Stay Regulation has accepted it as run (managed) by an
                    individual or community . The "Home Stay" seeks to draw tourists away from posh and crowded urban
                    areas to the rural locality full of splendid natural surroundings, by providing them with clean,
                    comfortable and budget-friendly accommodation and food. Thus, homestay offers the traveler a unique
                    local experience and possibilities of interaction with the host family. If offers the chance to
                    experience new and untapped places which has enabled the government to popularize new tourist
                    destinations, and provide alternative source of income to the rural folks . In home stay tourism
                    visitors get a chance to spend time with the family observing their customs,values and culture,
                    which gives them the opportunity to feel the taste of rural life . Cultural-heritage and its
                    geographical structure makes India one of the famous destinations for homestay tourism.<br> <br>

                    In homestay tourism, both the environment and culture are commoditized; market value is created with
                    the demand of visitors. This provides financial reward to the local indigenous community for
                    conservation of the environment and their culture . Under this approach tourism is considered to be
                    a component of development, giving emphasis to explore ways of expanding positive impacts and
                    reducing negative impacts . Home stay tourism is a major player when it comes to the reduction of
                    rural poverty. It integrates all activities of tourism such as trekking, cultural tourism,
                    agro-tourism, health tourism, and ecotourism . It is a good source of earning foreign currency. It
                    reduces the gap in the balance of payment, provides increased tax revenue, gives rise to economic
                    development of the nation, increases the employment opportunities. It may also provide new markets
                    for local people to sell their products, such as agricultural products, livestock and others .
                    Growth in tourism motivates people to pursue higher education and to obtain new jobs, and it thus
                    also increases the literacy rate. It provides opportunities for new generations to redefine and
                    reclaim their cultural and ethnic identity. The villagers and other concerns were given trainings in
                    hospitality and basic guiding skills to the local residents to provide them the opportunity to learn
                    about hygiene, tourism and conservation techniques. <br> <br>

                    Tourism must always preserve culture and promote it so as to use local resources and manpower to
                    promote the economy of a place. Hence, there is need to focus on sustainable development of tourism.
                    Homestay tourism will serve as a momentous tool to the development of rural areas in every sphere
                    including the economic, cultural, social and environmental spheres.

                <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

                <p>The Indian tourism market is huge and it has limitless offerings and products. The concerned stakeholders have to exploit and reap the benefits. However, most of the products have yet to be explored. Home-Stay is a micro tourism entrepreneurship. It is a new concept adopted in India. However, lot of enthusiastic groups (communities) and individuals are eager to run this business sans much idea and knowledge. Government lacks a concerted vision, plan, policy, strategy and program and this is a crucial aspect that must be addressed. It has to do a lot of homework because it can be an instrument of poverty mitigation a very valuable strategy. <br> <br>

                    Diverting international tourists to the rural destinations of India can and shoul be one of the tourism policies of the Indian government. It is advantageous to create a rural tourism environment and facilitate both the communities as well as private sectors to carry out the business to the benefit of all stakeholders in a win-win scenario There are nonetheless innumerable temporary challenges which can be resolved with appropriate strategies and careful planning

                <h1>WHY HOMESTAY ?</h1>

                <p>A HOMESTAY is essentially the commercialization of the home. This
                    commercialization has disrupted economies throughout the world, resulted
                    in gentrification and globalization, and is largely anything but cultural
                    tourism. Homestay tourism is a specialized cognitive form of tourism that
                    focuses on culture and heritage of the particular destination. Homestay
                    tourism is popular in many destinations; it adds authentic sociocultural
                    richness to the tourists experience. For a nation which possesses an
                    abundance of tourism richness in remote communities, homestays are an
                    attractive alternative tourism product. It was also homestay hosting is
                    beneficial to host families as it offers social interaction and preservation of
                    local culture, a sense of local pride, income and employment, and
                    educational opportunities for operators; children such as becoming more
                    multilingual. Homestays just as tourism industry would require manpower
                    with sufficient experience and training to deliver best homestay for the
                    tourists hence training for development, maintenance and operations of
                    homestays is vital aspect for the industry to grow more. <br> <br>

                    Home stay tourism is an emerging tourism concept evolved lately in the tourism world. India can be a
                    model homestay for its multi-faceted potentialities. Natural gifts, man-made heritages
                    ethno-cultural richness, innocent social settings, pleasant hospitality and many more unexplored
                    treasures that are dreams for experts of tourism. Homestay tourism cannot prosper sans the
                    convergence of needs of the affluent and the needy based on the premise of demand driven mechanism
                    because it is a need base concept. India can harness the boon of tourist potentiality rampant at the
                    rural areas where government has pro-poor programs. This form of tourism is based on three aspects
                    namely service, facility and attraction. India has a strong position only in attraction whereas it
                    is lacking in facility and services. Sustainable tourism takes place if home grown resources and
                    natural settings are effectively served to the tourism as well as also preserved. Promotion of
                    tourism thus is highly dependent upon the active participation of the private sector and communities
                    where the role of government becomes that of a facilitator.

                <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HOMESTAY</h1>

                <p> A Home-Stay, by its combined words (home stay) is staying in some one's home as a paying guest for
                    short time period. But such guests are provided accommodation and services by individual family and
                    community too. Therefore, the Home- Stay Regulation has accepted it as run (managed) by an
                    individual or community . The "Home Stay" seeks to draw tourists away from posh and crowded urban
                    areas to the rural locality full of splendid natural surroundings, by providing them with clean,
                    comfortable and budget-friendly accommodation and food. Thus, homestay offers the traveler a unique
                    local experience and possibilities of interaction with the host family. If offers the chance to
                    experience new and untapped places which has enabled the government to popularize new tourist
                    destinations, and provide alternative source of income to the rural folks . In home stay tourism
                    visitors get a chance to spend time with the family observing their customs,values and culture,
                    which gives them the opportunity to feel the taste of rural life . Cultural-heritage and its
                    geographical structure makes India one of the famous destinations for homestay tourism.<br> <br>

                    In homestay tourism, both the environment and culture are commoditized; market value is created with
                    the demand of visitors. This provides financial reward to the local indigenous community for
                    conservation of the environment and their culture . Under this approach tourism is considered to be
                    a component of development, giving emphasis to explore ways of expanding positive impacts and
                    reducing negative impacts . Home stay tourism is a major player when it comes to the reduction of
                    rural poverty. It integrates all activities of tourism such as trekking, cultural tourism,
                    agro-tourism, health tourism, and ecotourism . It is a good source of earning foreign currency. It
                    reduces the gap in the balance of payment, provides increased tax revenue, gives rise to economic
                    development of the nation, increases the employment opportunities. It may also provide new markets
                    for local people to sell their products, such as agricultural products, livestock and others .
                    Growth in tourism motivates people to pursue higher education and to obtain new jobs, and it thus
                    also increases the literacy rate. It provides opportunities for new generations to redefine and
                    reclaim their cultural and ethnic identity. The villagers and other concerns were given trainings in
                    hospitality and basic guiding skills to the local residents to provide them the opportunity to learn
                    about hygiene, tourism and conservation techniques. <br> <br>

                    Tourism must always preserve culture and promote it so as to use local resources and manpower to
                    promote the economy of a place. Hence, there is need to focus on sustainable development of tourism.
                    Homestay tourism will serve as a momentous tool to the development of rural areas in every sphere
                    including the economic, cultural, social and environmental spheres.

                <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

                <p>The Indian tourism market is huge and it has limitless offerings and products. The concerned stakeholders have to exploit and reap the benefits. However, most of the products have yet to be explored. Home-Stay is a micro tourism entrepreneurship. It is a new concept adopted in India. However, lot of enthusiastic groups (communities) and individuals are eager to run this business sans much idea and knowledge. Government lacks a concerted vision, plan, policy, strategy and program and this is a crucial aspect that must be addressed. It has to do a lot of homework because it can be an instrument of poverty mitigation a very valuable strategy. <br> <br>

                    Diverting international tourists to the rural destinations of India can and shoul be one of the tourism policies of the Indian government. It is advantageous to create a rural tourism environment and facilitate both the communities as well as private sectors to carry out the business to the benefit of all stakeholders in a win-win scenario There are nonetheless innumerable temporary challenges which can be resolved with appropriate strategies and careful planning

                <h1>WHY HOMESTAY ?</h1>

                <p>A HOMESTAY is essentially the commercialization of the home. This
                    commercialization has disrupted economies throughout the world, resulted
                    in gentrification and globalization, and is largely anything but cultural
                    tourism. Homestay tourism is a specialized cognitive form of tourism that
                    focuses on culture and heritage of the particular destination. Homestay
                    tourism is popular in many destinations; it adds authentic sociocultural
                    richness to the tourists experience. For a nation which possesses an
                    abundance of tourism richness in remote communities, homestays are an
                    attractive alternative tourism product. It was also homestay hosting is
                    beneficial to host families as it offers social interaction and preservation of
                    local culture, a sense of local pride, income and employment, and
                    educational opportunities for operators; children such as becoming more
                    multilingual. Homestays just as tourism industry would require manpower
                    with sufficient experience and training to deliver best homestay for the
                    tourists hence training for development, maintenance and operations of
                    homestays is vital aspect for the industry to grow more. <br> <br>

                    Home stay tourism is an emerging tourism concept evolved lately in the tourism world. India can be a
                    model homestay for its multi-faceted potentialities. Natural gifts, man-made heritages
                    ethno-cultural richness, innocent social settings, pleasant hospitality and many more unexplored
                    treasures that are dreams for experts of tourism. Homestay tourism cannot prosper sans the
                    convergence of needs of the affluent and the needy based on the premise of demand driven mechanism
                    because it is a need base concept. India can harness the boon of tourist potentiality rampant at the
                    rural areas where government has pro-poor programs. This form of tourism is based on three aspects
                    namely service, facility and attraction. India has a strong position only in attraction whereas it
                    is lacking in facility and services. Sustainable tourism takes place if home grown resources and
                    natural settings are effectively served to the tourism as well as also preserved. Promotion of
                    tourism thus is highly dependent upon the active participation of the private sector and communities
                    where the role of government becomes that of a facilitator.

                <h1>INTRODUCTION TO HOMESTAY</h1>

                <p> A Home-Stay, by its combined words (home stay) is staying in some one's home as a paying guest for
                    short time period. But such guests are provided accommodation and services by individual family and
                    community too. Therefore, the Home- Stay Regulation has accepted it as run (managed) by an
                    individual or community . The "Home Stay" seeks to draw tourists away from posh and crowded urban
                    areas to the rural locality full of splendid natural surroundings, by providing them with clean,
                    comfortable and budget-friendly accommodation and food. Thus, homestay offers the traveler a unique
                    local experience and possibilities of interaction with the host family. If offers the chance to
                    experience new and untapped places which has enabled the government to popularize new tourist
                    destinations, and provide alternative source of income to the rural folks . In home stay tourism
                    visitors get a chance to spend time with the family observing their customs,values and culture,
                    which gives them the opportunity to feel the taste of rural life . Cultural-heritage and its
                    geographical structure makes India one of the famous destinations for homestay tourism.<br> <br>

                    In homestay tourism, both the environment and culture are commoditized; market value is created with
                    the demand of visitors. This provides financial reward to the local indigenous community for
                    conservation of the environment and their culture . Under this approach tourism is considered to be
                    a component of development, giving emphasis to explore ways of expanding positive impacts and
                    reducing negative impacts . Home stay tourism is a major player when it comes to the reduction of
                    rural poverty. It integrates all activities of tourism such as trekking, cultural tourism,
                    agro-tourism, health tourism, and ecotourism . It is a good source of earning foreign currency. It
                    reduces the gap in the balance of payment, provides increased tax revenue, gives rise to economic
                    development of the nation, increases the employment opportunities. It may also provide new markets
                    for local people to sell their products, such as agricultural products, livestock and others .
                    Growth in tourism motivates people to pursue higher education and to obtain new jobs, and it thus
                    also increases the literacy rate. It provides opportunities for new generations to redefine and
                    reclaim their cultural and ethnic identity. The villagers and other concerns were given trainings in
                    hospitality and basic guiding skills to the local residents to provide them the opportunity to learn
                    about hygiene, tourism and conservation techniques. <br> <br>

                    Tourism must always preserve culture and promote it so as to use local resources and manpower to
                    promote the economy of a place. Hence, there is need to focus on sustainable development of tourism.
                    Homestay tourism will serve as a momentous tool to the development of rural areas in every sphere
                    including the economic, cultural, social and environmental spheres.

However, most of the products have yet to be explored. Home-Stay is a micro tourism entrepreneurship. It is a new concept adopted in India. However, lot of enthusiastic groups (communities) and individuals are eager to run this business sans much idea and knowledge. Government lacks a concerted vision, plan, policy, strategy and program and this is a crucial aspect that must be addressed. It has to do a lot of homework because it can be an instrument of poverty mitigation a very valuable strategy. <br> <br>

                    Diverting international tourists to the rural destinations of India can and shoul be one of the tourism policies of the Indian government. It is advantageous to create a rural tourism environment and facilitate both the communities as well as private sectors to carry out the business to the benefit of all stakeholders in a win-win scenario There are nonetheless innumerable temporary challenges which can be resolved with appropriate strategies and careful planning
