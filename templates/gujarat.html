                <h3>INTRODUCTION -</h3>

                <p>Gujarat lies on India's west coast. Part of its western boundary lies at the edge of Pakistan. Its coastline runs from near the mouth of the Indus River, curves around the great peninsula of Saurashtra, and swings south to a point about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Bombay. Gujarat has three broad geographic divisions: mainland Gujarat, the Saurashtra Peninsula, and Kachch. Mainland Gujarat consists of coastal plains. These merge with lowlands around Ahmadabad and northern Gujarat. Fringing this area on the north and east are the uplands of the southern Aravallis, the western Vindhya and Satpura Ranges, and the Western Ghats. The southern areas are good for farming, even though most of the state is dry. <br> <br>

                    The Saurashtra (also known as Kathiawar) region consists of a peninsula bounded by the Gulf of Cambay, the Arabian Sea, and the Gulf of Kachch. Broad coastal plains surround low plateaus and hills. One of these, Gir Range (about 2,100 feet or 640 meters), is home to a wildlife sanctuary for the last Asian lion population in the world. The Rann, a vast expanse of tidal mud flats and salt marshes, take up much of Kachch.  <br> <br>

                    The language, Gujarati, comes from Sanskritâ€”an ancient language. There are several dialects of Gujarati. These include Kachchi, Kathiawadi, and Surati. Bhili, a language similar to Gujarati, is spoken by tribal groups in northern and eastern Gujarat. Gujarati is written in a cursive script. Many Gujaratis can also understand and speak Hindi.

                <h3>MUSIC -</h3>

                <p> Gujarati music has gained some attention and has been making its vital contributions since a very long time. There are several rags who's original roots can be traced back to Gujarat these include - Gujari Todi, Bilaval (from Veraval), Sorathi, Khambavati, Ahiri and Lati. These are a few of the many priceless gifts of music that Gujarat has given to classical Hindustani music. Gujarat has been successful in preserving its musical authenticity and have actively been involved in not losing its musical heritage that is now a pride of Gujarat. <br> <br>

                    Rann Utsav is one of the ways through which you can experience the glorious culturally enriched musical gift of Gujarat. The community who is to be thanked for keeping their music alive are the communities of Charans and Gadhavis, whose hereditary profession has been to carry on the lineage of Gujarati folk music. Some common types of Gujarati folk songs are - Lullaby, Nuptial songs and festive songs.
