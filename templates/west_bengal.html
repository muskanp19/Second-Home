                <h3>INTRODUCTION -</h3>

                <p> West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India along the Bay of Bengal. With over 91 million inhabitants, it is the fourth-most populous state and the thirteenth-largest state by area in India. Covering an area of 88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi), it is also the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world. Part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it borders Bangladesh in the east, and Nepal and Bhutan in the north. It also borders the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata, the third-largest metropolis, and seventh largest city by population in India. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region, the coastal Sundarbans and the Bay of Bengal. The state's main ethnic group are the Bengalis, with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority. <br><br>
                    The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas, while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. The region was part of several ancient pan−Indian empires, including the Vangas, Mauryans, and the Guptas. The citadel of Gauḍa served as the capital of the Gauḍa Kingdom, the Pala Empire, and the Sena Empire. Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate, but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region. During the Bengal Sultanate, the territory was a major trading nation in the world, and was often referred by the Europeans as the "richest country to trade with". It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Simultaneously, some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states, and Baro-Bhuyan landlords, and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire. Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s, the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal, and showed signs of the first Industrial revolution. The region was later conquered by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and became part of the Bengal Presidency.

                <h3>MUSIC &amp; DANCE -</h3>

                <p> A notable music tradition is the Baul music, practised by the Bauls, a sect of mystic minstrels Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. Shyama Sangeet is a genre of devotional songs, praising the Hindu goddess Kali; kirtan is devotional group songs dedicated to the god Krishna. Like other states in northern India, West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. Rabindrasangeet, songs composed and set to words by Rabindranath Tagore, and Nazrul geeti (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta's songs, and adhunik or modern music from films and other composers.[181] From the early 1990s, new genres of music have emerged, including what has been called Bengali Jeebonmukhi Gaan (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chhau dance of Purulia is a rare form of masked dance. <br><br>
                    A state renowned for its rich cultural variety, dance is an essential part that showcases the culture of West Bengal. Each region in the state has its own unique dance form to exhibit, based not only on the culture and history of the region but on worldwide themes that affect society and art as a whole. This remarkably unique feature of blending both the international themes with regional culture and tradition is another highlight of a culture so rare in the world. The Brita dance is a traditional folk dance of West Bengal performed by women who seek blessings from the Gods so the wishes of their children are fulfilled. The dance is also performed when a person or their loved ones recover from a contagious or life threatening disease. The Gambhira dance is a dance performed mainly during festivals in the state. The theme of this devotional folk dance is based on social, political and moral problems of contemporary society. Popular in the north Bengal districts, the dance is a solo performance in which the participant wears a mask while performing. The Santhal dance is an extremely vibrant and cheerful dance which is performed by both men and women of the Santhali tribe.

                <h3>CULTUER -</h3>

                <p> The Bengali language boasts a rich literary heritage it shares with neighbouring Bangladesh. West Bengal has a long tradition of folk literature, evidenced by the Charyapada, a collection of Buddhist mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries; Mangalkavya, a collection of Hindu narrative poetry composed around the 13th century; Shreekrishna Kirtana, a pastoral Vaishnava drama in verse composed by Boru Chandidas; Thakurmar Jhuli, a collection of Bengali folk and fairy tales compiled by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumder; and stories of Gopal Bhar, a court jester in medieval Bengal. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period; Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse; and Rabindranath Tagore, who reshaped Bengali literature and music. Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam, whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of Nazrul Sangeet, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed, and Manik Bandyopadhyay, who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction. In modern times, Jibanananda Das has been acknowledged as "the premier poet of the post-Tagore era in India". Other writers include: Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, best known for his work Pather Panchali; Tarashankar Bandopadhyay, well known for his portrayal of the lower strata of society; Manik Bandopadhyay, a pioneering novelist; and Ashapurna Devi, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, Saradindu Bandopadhyay, Buddhadeb Guha, Mahashweta Devi, Samaresh Majumdar, Sanjeev Chattopadhyay, Shakti Chattopadhyay, Buddhadeb Basu,[176] Joy Goswami and Sunil Gangopadhyay.

                <h3>RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM -</h3>

                <p>This paper is an attempt to focus on religious and cultural
                    syncretism between the Hindus and the Muslims in Bengal
                    during medieval period on the basis of original sources with
                    special reference to contemporary Bengali Vernacular literature. I
                    have also sought to study in this paper how this syncretism between
                    the Hindus and the Muslims was revealed in the religious and
                    cultural life of the Bengalis under the period of study.
                    Medieval Bengal has neither any authoritative nor any
                    continuous contemporary socio-cultural historiography. Mirza
                    Nathan’s Persian work Baharistan-i-Ghaibi, “an oasis in the desert
                    of historical ignorance”, in Sir J. N. Sarkar’s words, is a political
                    history, which hardly throws light on the social condition of
                    Bengal. <br><br>
                     Nevertheless, Bengali literature had attained its maturity
                    and had definitely come into being during the period under review
                    in Bengal. Though no original work on the social history of Bengal
                    exists, the typical Bengali mind was truly portrayed in the literature
                    of this period. <br><br>
                    Theoretically Islam has no relation with Hinduism. Islam and
                    Hinduism stand in marked contrast to each other. Islam stands for
                    transcendence; the command of Allah is all, Islam is complete
                    resignation to the will of God and the Muslims are the resigned
                    ones. Hinduism stands for immanence; the “divine without” is
                    an expression of the “divine within”. Its ultimate wisdom is the
                    aphorism, “Thou art that”, and this leads to incarnations of the deity
                    and his worships in many forms. On the plane of social teaching
                    Islam inculcates the idea of brotherhood making every man equal
                    before God, irrespective of caste, nationality, race or colour.
                    Contrasted with this is the religiously sanctified inequality of castes
                    in Hindu society.
